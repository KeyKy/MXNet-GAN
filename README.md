# MXNet-GAN
MXNet Implementation of various GAN, including: DCGAN [1], CGAN [2], Image-to-Image translation [3] (a.k.a. pix2pix)  

This is a working repo initially served as the final project for [UIUC ECE544NA](https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/ece544na/fa2017/_site/).  

## Prerequisites
- Linux (Tested in Ubuntu 16.04)
- Python 2 (You may need to modify some codes if you are using Python 3)
- CPU or NVIDIA GPU + CUDA CuDNN

## Getting Started
### Installation
- Build MXNet from source (tested using MXNet version v.0.11.1).
  ```bash
  git clone --recursive https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet mxnet
  cd mxnet
  cp make/config.mk .
  vim config.mk  # You need to change configuration in order to enable cuda and cudnn 
  make -j8
  cd python
  sudo python setup.py install
  ```
- Clone this repo:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/bowenc0221/MXNet-GAN
  cd MXNet-GAN
  ```
- Put MXNet python package into ```./external/mxnet/$(MXNET_VERSION)``` and modify ```MXNET_VERSION``` in ```./experiments/*.yaml``` to ```$(YOUR_MXNET_PACKAGE)```.
- Install python packages.
  ```bash
  pip install Cython
  pip install EasyDict
  pip install opencv-python
  ```

### DCGAN train/test

### CGAN train/test

### pix2pix train/test
- Download a pix2pix dataset (e.g.facades):
  ```bash
  bash ./datasets/download_pix2pix_dataset.sh facades
  ```
  Please refer to [pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix](https://github.com/bowenc0221/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix) for dataset information.
- Train a model:
  ```bash
  python pix2pix/train.py --cfg experiments/mxnet_pix2pix.yaml
  ```
- Test a model:
  ```bash
  python pix2pix/test.py --cfg experiments/mxnet_pix2pix.yaml
  ```
